# Christmas-Roulette
This program generates a random ordering of a given list of names. Good for deciding orders for things.

There are probably random order generators out there, but what am I to learn if I use those? :^). Here's my attempt at making something useful for the most wonderful time of the year.
Any feedback on this code is much appreciated!
